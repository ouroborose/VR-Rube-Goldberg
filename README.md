### Platform
HTC Vive

### Time to Completion
20-25 hours

### One thing I liked
I really enjoyed implementing and trying the different locomotion examples for High Immersion VR. It was interesting seeing the similarities and differences between developing for GoogleVR vs SteamVR.

### One thing that was challenging
Designing levels became a chore with the position, put on headset, test, reposition, put on headset, test, repeat cycle. The levels that felt simple to me turned out to be difficult to my primary tester, and vice versa. The Rube Goldberg items were similarly difficult to tune with constantly having to move in and out of the device. Coupled along with faulty controllers that kept un-pairing, made for a frustrating time sink.
